# Face-Detection-CPS803

## Check out our demo app
Try running demo_webcamapp.py!

•Developed an app that performs face detection using  different Machine Learning methods for my course in university. The project used supervised learning algorithms (Neural Network, SVM, Haar-Cascade Classifier) for final classification, and unsupervised learning  algorithms like PCA for feature extraction.
                                                                                
•Team project with 4 other members, completed in 13 weeks
•Coded with Python, and using Python Libraries like OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Keras.
